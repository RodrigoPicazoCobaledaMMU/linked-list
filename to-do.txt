To do:
  Shouldn't be too hard to implement:
  - Function to insert at front and end of linked list.
  - Function to delete a node by value.
  - Function to count amount of nodes.
  
  A bit more advanced:
  - Function to search for a value, return position or -1 if not found.
  - Reverse the list.
  - Sort the list by id.
  - Let the user build the list.

  Well in the future:
  - Implement a doubly linked list.
  - Implement a circular linked list.

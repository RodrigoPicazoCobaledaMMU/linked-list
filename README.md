# LINKED LIST 

## What's the purpose of this code ? 
Honestly ? This is just a very simple program I've made in around half a day to learn what a linked list is, what it's use is and how to implement it.
I didn't design this program to be something extraordinary just something to mess around and learn on.

## How to compile ?
Run make in terminal and it should compile and generate a linkedList file you can run, run make clean to clean up the executable file.

## What did I learn ? 
A very basic view on how linked lists work, how to use them in functions and just implementing them in general

More features will come soon.
